# First GitHub Repo!
This is my Transaction Tracker made from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Project started on 11th December 2020.

# How It Works:
1. User inputs transaction name and amount.
2. User will click either + (income) or - (expense).
3. Object is created consisting of transaction name, amount and date.
4. Object is inserted into a transaction array.
5. The balance is calculated by adding or subtracting the transaction amount from each object in the array.
6. User can delete the transaction item which will delete it in the transaction array to re-calculate the balance.
