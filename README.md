# First GitHub Repo!
This is my Transaction Tracker made from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Project started on 11th December 2020.

# How It Works:
1. User inputs transaction name and amount.
2. User will click either + (income) or - (expense).
3. Object is created consisting of transaction name, amount and date.
4. The balance is calculated by adding or subtracting the transaction amount from balance amount.
5. User can delete the transaction item which will add or subtract to re-calculate the current balance.
